// What draws have proved about one shader's descriptors: the `first_use_pc` of every resource a
// materialization had to bind null because its source is selected on the GPU. A pc here is proof,
// not a guess, so resource tracking may claim it as a runtime table on the next translation.
//
// Split out of PipelineCache so the rollback below can be tested without a Vulkan device, the way
// PipelineBuildGate already is.
//
// The reason a rollback exists at all: claiming a proven pc changes what the backend emits, and
// for RESIDENT EVIL REQUIEM's clustered-lighting pixel shader it emits a dispatcher module of
// 384046 words that this host's driver will not build - measured twice at over 200 s inside
// vkCreateGraphicsPipelines, once ending in a dead process. MaxDispatcherSpirvWords refuses that
// module, which is right, but a refusal used to travel to `skipped_shaders`, and that set is keyed
// on the shader hash alone with no generation in it. So the refusal disabled the shader outright -
// including the permutation from the generation before, which was drawing perfectly well, just
// without the one resource the channel was trying to recover. Losing an effect is the bug the
// channel was written to fix; losing the shader is worse than the bug.

// nothing: one rebuild per (shader, descriptor), not one per draw. Pipeline builds for RE9's
// heaviest pixel shaders run to tens of seconds, so a loop here would be far worse than the
// missing effect it is trying to fix.
