// A shader that dereferences a raw guest pointer can reach any mapped byte, so before such a
// draw or dispatch every buffer the pointer could land in has to be current. PrepareBda used to
// establish that by walking every mapped range every time. This set is the same obligation kept
// as state: it is appended where memory actually changes hands and drained by the per-draw path.
//
// Two ordering rules carry the whole safety argument:
//
//   * Queue runs AFTER the state change it reports, never before. A queue that lands before its
//     dirty bit can be swallowed by a drain that has already walked past that page, and the page
//     would then never be uploaded - it reads as zero on the GPU and its stores are dropped.
//   * Take removes the whole set in one step, so anything queued from that moment on lands in
//     the fresh set and is drained next time. Being wrong in this direction costs one redundant
//     walk, which is why it is the direction to be wrong in.

// above its state change changes nothing. It was verified by inverting one queue and watching the
// suite still pass. So the rule is enforced here instead - a scope-exit queue happens after every
// state change in its scope no matter where the declaration is written or how a future merge moves
// it.
//
// Declare it *after* any early return that means no state changed. Getting that wrong queues a
// range that did not need it, which costs one redundant walk and is the direction this class is
// designed to be wrong in; getting the explicit-call ordering wrong loses an upload permanently.
