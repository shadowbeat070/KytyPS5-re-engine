// What the emulator does when device memory runs out. `memoryHeadroom.h` holds the two decisions
// - which allocation tiers may be tried, and which cached image the collector may release - as
// constexpr functions over plain facts, so both are exercised here with no Vulkan device.
//
// The pair that matters most is the collector's. Commit 088464ed fixed a real bug (an image whose
// pixels exist only on the GPU was being freed outright, presenting a whole black frame) by making
// the collector keep anything it could not write back. The cost was that it then kept almost
// everything RESIDENT EVIL REQUIEM renders, because those surfaces are tiled and GPU-modified, and
// tiling vetoed collection. Eviction separates "cannot be written back" from "has not been written
// back yet". The tests below pin both halves: 088464ed's rule still holds, and tiling no longer
// decides anything.
